//4. Paint Job Estimator
//A painting company has determined that for every 115 square feet of wall space, one gallon
//of paint and eight hours of labor will be required. The company charges $18.00 per hour
//for labor. Write a program that allows the user to enter the number of rooms to be painted
//and the price of the paint per gallon. It should also ask for the square feet of wall space in
//each room. The program should have methods that return the following data:
//• The number of gallons of paint required
//• The hours of labor required
//• The cost of the paint
//• The labor charges
//• The total cost of the paint job
//Then it should display the data on the screen.
